### I'm only doing this to complete the tutorial, so here is a haiku
A file that big?
It might be very useful.
But now it is gone.

No keyboard present
Hit F1 to continue
Zen engineering?

Website has been moved
We'd tell you where, but then we'd
Have to delete you.

The web site you seek
Cannot be located but
Countless more exist.

Aborted effort:
Close all that you have worked on.
You ask way too much.

Windows XP crashed.
I am the blue screen of death.
No one hears your screams.

Yesterday it worked.
Today it is not working.
Windows is like that.
